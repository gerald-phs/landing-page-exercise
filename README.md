# Landing Page Study Project  
There are two things that are relevant:
1. I have discovered APIs. I am god

2.
>"Lumber`h`acks". 

I came up with that. ~~Is that allowed?~~ (*I reflected on it for 3 hours and came to a conclusion that it's a good joke.*) 

At any rate, in this project, a rudimentary landing page has been designed so I can practice some CSS. I like it a lot! (*CSS*, that is. The webpage, however... I wouldn't say it's a sight to behold. **Yet**!)
