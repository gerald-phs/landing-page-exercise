# Landing Page Study Project
[thereIsNoUnseeingThis.html](https://gerald-phs.github.io/landing-page-exercise/)
## There are 3 things that are relevant here:
1. Eggs
2. I have discovered APIs. I am god
3. 

>"Lumber`h`acks". 

I came up with that. ~~Is it allowed?~~ (*I reflected on it for 3 hours and came to a conclusion that it's a good joke.*) 

At any rate, in this project, a rudimentary landing page has been designed so I can practice some CSS. I like it a lot! (*CSS*, that is. The webpage, however...)  

*Look, I went through the code earlier today and it is **not** finished at all. I'll come back to this later, but right now JavaScript beckons~*  

### Expected result:
![Webpage example](reference-webpage.png "The Odin Project's webpage example")  
### Styles guide:
![CSS data](reference-styles-data.png "The Odin Project's webpage assigment proposed CSS values")
